# health-monitoring
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook-based project focused on health data monitoring and analysis using Python. It demonstrates methods for importing, cleaning, visualizing, and deriving insights from health-related datasets, leveraging popular Python libraries for data science.


Health Monitoring and Analysis using Python
Overview
This repository features a Jupyter Notebook-based project dedicated to the analysis and visualization of health-related data using Python. It provides practical examples of data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deriving actionable insights to monitor health trends.

Features
Data Import & Cleaning: Demonstrates techniques for preparing raw health datasets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes key health metrics and identifies patterns.

Insight Generation: Provides examples of extracting meaningful conclusions from health data.

Pythonic Workflow: Utilizes popular data science libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

Getting Started
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/eddymontana/health-monitoring.git
cd health-monitoring
Dataset: (Optional, if applicable) Place your health data files (e.g., CSV, Excel) in a data/ directory.

Environment Setup:

Bash

conda create -n health_analysis python=3.9 # Or your preferred Python version
conda activate health_analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt # (Ensure you create this file from your environment)
Run Notebook: Open and execute health_monitoring_analysis.ipynb (or your notebook's name) to follow the analysis steps.

Requirements
Key libraries used include:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scipy (if statistical tests are included)
